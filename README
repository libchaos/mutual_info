relatedness
===========

Given a set of documents in different classes, assign scores to each term appearing in the documents
and each class giving the degree of relatedness between the term and the class.

To calculate the relatedness scores for the example dataset:

python relatedness.py example_class_freq.txt < example_term_class_freq.txt > example_relatedness.txt

The first input file, in this case example_class_freq.txt, is a tab-delimited file with a row for each class
and the following columns:

classid: id or distinct name of the class
n: # of documents in the class associated with classid

For example:

classid	n
0	100
1	50
2 10
3	20

The second input file, in this case example_term_class_freq.txt, is a tab-delimited text file with a row for each combination of a term and
a class and the following columns:

termid: id or distinct name of the term
classid: id or distinct name of the class
n: # of documents where the term associated with termid appears in a document in the class associated with classid

For example:

termid	classid	n
0	0	10
1	0	5
1 1	30
2	1	100

If a certain combination is not included, then it is assumed that there are no documents in the class where the term appears. 

The output file, in this case example_relatedness.txt, is a tab-delimited text with a row for each combination of a term and
a class and the following columns:

termid: id or distinct name of the term
classid: id or distinct name of the class
r: relatedness score, the higher the score the more related the term is to the class

For example:

termid	classid	r
0	0	.8
1	0	.1
1 1	.7
2	1	.9
