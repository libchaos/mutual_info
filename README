mutual_info
===========

Given a set of documents in different classes, calculate the mutual information of each term appearing in the documents by comparing frequencies of the term in each class to frequencies in the rest of the classes.

To calculate mutual information for the example datasets:

python mutual_info.py class_freq.txt term_class_freq.txt mutual_info.txt

The first input file, in this case class_freq.txt, is a tab-delimited file 
with a row for each class and the following columns:

classid: id or distinct name of the class
n: # of documents in the class associated with classid

For example:

classid	n
0	100
1	50
2	10
3	20

The second input file, in this case term_class_freq.txt, is a tab-delimited 
text file with a row for each combination of a term and a class and the following columns:

termid: id or distinct name of the term
classid: id or distinct name of the class
n: # of documents where the term associated with termid appears in a document in the class associated with classid

For example:

termid	classid	n
0	0	10
1	0	5
1	1	30
2	1	100

If a certain combination is not included, then it is assumed that there are 
no documents in the class where the term appears. 

The output file, in this case mutual_info.txt, is a tab-delimited 
text file with a row for each combination of a term and a class and the following columns:

termid: id or distinct name of the term
classid: id or distinct name of the class
mi: mutual information of the term with the class as the reference class

For example:

termid	classid	mi
0	0	.8
1	0	.1
1	1	.7
2	1	.9
