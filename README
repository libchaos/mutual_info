relatedness
===========

Given observations of entities from multiple classes, assign scores to each entity and each class
giving the degree of relatedness between the entity and the class.

To calculate the relatedness score for the example dataset:

python relatedness.py < example_input.txt > example_output.txt

The input file, in this case example_input.txt, is a tab-delimited text file with a row for each combination of an entity and
a class with some number of observations and the following columns:

ENTITYID: id or distinct name of the entity
CLASSID: id or distinct name of the class
N: # of obs of the entity associated with the ENTITYID in the class associated with the CLASSID

For example:

ENTITYID	CLASSID	N
0	0	10
1	0	5
1 1	30
2	1	100

If a certain combination is not included, then it is assumed that there are no observations of that combination. 

The output file, in this case example_output.txt, is a tab-delimited text with a row for each combination of an entity and
a class with some number of observations and the following columns:

ENTITYID: id or distinct name of the entity
CLASSID: id or distinct name of the class
R: relatedness score, the higher the score the more related the entity is to the class

For example:

ENTITYID	CLASSID	R
0	0	.8
1	0	.1
1 1	.7
2	1	.9
